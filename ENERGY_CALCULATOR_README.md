## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Custom UI components built on Radix UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useMemo, useCallback)
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation

### Project Structure
```
frontend/src/pages/EnergyCalculator.tsx    # Main calculator component
frontend/src/App.tsx                       # Routing configuration
frontend/src/layouts/components/Header.tsx # Navigation updates
frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx           # Homepage integration
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Types and Interfaces
```typescript
interface Appliance {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  power: number; // Watts
  typical_usage: number; // Hours per day
  efficiency_rating?: 'High' | 'Medium' | 'Low';
  energy_efficient_alternative?: {
    name: string;
    power: number;
    savings_percentage: number;
  };
}

interface CalculatorAppliance extends Appliance {
  quantity: number;
  daily_hours: number;
  monthly_cost: number;
  yearly_cost: number;
}
```

#### 2. Bangladesh Electricity Rates Implementation
```typescript
const ELECTRICITY_RATES = [
  { min: 0, max: 75, rate: 5.26 },
  { min: 76, max: 200, rate: 7.20 },
  { min: 201, max: 300, rate: 7.59 },
  { min: 301, max: 400, rate: 8.02 },
  { min: 401, max: 600, rate: 12.67 },
  { min: 601, max: Infinity, rate: 14.61 }
];

const ADDITIONAL_CHARGES = {
  demand_charge: 42, // Per month
  vat_rate: 0.05, // 5%
  meter_rent: 40, // Per month
  rebate_rate: 0.005 // 0.5%
};
```

#### 3. Cost Calculation Algorithm
The calculator implements Bangladesh's tiered pricing system:
1. Calculate monthly consumption in kWh
2. Apply tiered rates progressively
3. Add additional charges (demand charge, meter rent, VAT)
4. Subtract applicable rebates
5. Display detailed cost breakdown
